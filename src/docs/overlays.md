## Dialogs

A dialog is a small window that requires the users's immediate attention.

The user has to actively dismiss the dialog by clicking on a button.

*Modal Dialogs* block user input on the underlying screen.


## Toasts

A Toast is a message (with optional button) that does not stop the app flow.



## Popovers

A popover is a small text box above or next to a target
element. Usually a tooltip, but it can also be a menu.
