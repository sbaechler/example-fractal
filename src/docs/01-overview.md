## About this Guide

### Documentation

The documentation is written in Markdown using 
[GitHub flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).


### Component Library

The structure of the living style guide is based on 
[GE's Predix Design system](https://medium.com/ge-design/ges-predix-design-system-8236d47b0891).

It is split into 6 sections:

1. **Applications:** This section contains full pages like they appear on the website.
2. **Features** allow the user to accomplish a task. E.g. uploading a file or editing a database entry.
3. **Templates** document the layout and structure of a section or the entirety of an interface.
    Design patterns that deal more with layout go into Templates.
4. **Components** contain the user interface patterns that fall on the moderately complex side of the spectrum.
5. **Basics** are the smallest structures of a user interface. They can not be broken down any further.
6. **Principles** don't provide any actual code but are the foundational level of the design system.
